    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>On a Saturday morning I was woken up early by my father. The moment i woke up I knew something will change. So, as I wake to the bathroom to wash my face and stuff, my dad told my brothers and me to have breakfast and then meet him outside. So, right after breakfast we went to see him.Long story short, it was the day that we start doing some gardening. We palnted long beans, tomatoes, chillies, tumerics and lemongrasses. Since that day, my rountine changed a little bit untill the day our class started which had a huge impact on my shcedule.</p>

      <p>Some call me Izz some call me Syafiq. I prefer my friends and other people call me Izz though because my family call me Syafiq but there are exceptions. Other than that, I'm a normal dude like nothing special. Some say I'm easy to get along with but I dont know if it's true. I like JDM cars, I'm straight, bad fashion sense, a'int very smart and I'm 20 this year.</p>
